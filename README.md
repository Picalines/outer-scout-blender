## Usage

### Extracting game assets

In order to import planet meshes into Blender you firstly need to extract mesh assets from the game. I've tested this with AssetStudio, maybe some newer program would also do.

- Open AssetStudio
- `File > Load Folder`
- Select your Outer Wilds's data folder (`OuterWilds_Data`)
- `Options > Export options`, set the `Group exported assets by` option to `container path`
- `Filter type > Mesh`
- `Export > Filtered assets`
